 # PLEASE READ UNTIL THE END SOBS
One thing that people have a huge problem with is joking about health problems such as seizures, cancer, diabetes, disorders, autism, ECT. Please walk me through on how y'all mfs think joking about these topics are funny. They aren't and if you joke about shit like that like "I'm having a seizure", "Im autistic", when you don't suffer from any health problems then y'all actually need to grow the fuck up. Idk where people thought about joking about health and disabilities were humorous but if you do your fucking sick and you need fucking help because you joking about shit like that just proves how immature and disgusting you actually fucking are. Please grow tf up



Same goes for rape. If you joke about rape, your most likely a fucking rapist yourself. Get some fucking help if you joke about rape because not at all is it funny nor was it never. Please tell me what's funny about a woman / man getting raped? Please tell me what's funny about you joking about yourself or someone else getting raped? Nothing. Joking about shit like that is fucking unfunny and you need fucking help.

Also, not everyone is homophobic even if they don't support the Lgbt. Not everyone can support it due to religions and the way the were raised. No, just because someone is straight doesn't mean they are homophobic. No you shouldn't harass someone who doesn't support the lgbt because what good is it doing for you? what are you getting out of it? Pls be aware of that <3
